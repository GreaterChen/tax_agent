    "question_en": "When should I pay my first HKICPA annual fee?",
    "answer_en": [
      "The first HKICPA annual fee is due upon application or shortly thereafter. Here are the key points based on the available information:\n\n1. **Fees Upon Application**: According to several sources, fees are payable upon application [Source: https://www.hkicpa.org.hk/-/media/HKICPA-Website/HKICPA/section7_china_and_international/China-and-international/international/form/iafee.pdf?la=en&hash=5BAEECDA8C1D473C68D6259E0CBB9E67]. This suggests that the initial annual subscription fee would be paid at the same time as the application process.\n\n2. **Annual Subscription Fee Due Date**: The Annual Subscription fee for HKICPA members is generally due on January 1 of each year [Source: https://www.hkicpa.org.hk/file/media/section2_become_a_hk_cpa/QP/pdf-file/stud-dl-form/2016/Fee%20Schedule%20(2016).pdf]. However, for new applicants, this fee is due immediately following the date of registration [Source: https://www.hkicpa.org.hk/-/media/HKICPA-Website/HKICPA/section2_become_a_hk_cpa/QP/bsr-a2.pdf].\n\n3. **Specific Fee Example**: For the year 2025, the IA annual fee is set at HK$2,650, with HK$90 allocated to the Capital Fund [Source: https://www.hkicpa.org.hk/-/media/HKICPA-Website/HKICPA/section7_china_and_international/China-and-international/international/form/iafee.pdf?la=en&hash=5BAEECDA8C1D473C68D6259E0CBB9E67].\n\n4. **Waivers and Discounts**: There are instances where HKICPA members may receive waivers or discounts when applying for membership in other organizations, such as ACCA offering a waiver of the new member admission fee from November 25, 2024, to May 31, 2025 [Source: https://www.accaglobal.com/hk/en/member/membership/apply-from-other-bodies/HKICPA/2024-offer.html]. However, these do not directly affect the timing of the HKICPA annual fee.\n\nIn summary, the first HKICPA annual fee should be paid upon application or shortly after registration, with subsequent annual fees due on January 1 of each year. If you are a new applicant, ensure that your first annual subscription fee is paid promptly following your registration date [Source: https://www.hkicpa.org.hk/-/media/HKICPA-Website/HKICPA/section2_become_a_hk_cpa/QP/bsr-a2.pdf]. \n\nPlease verify specific dates and amounts with HKICPA directly for the most accurate and up-to-date information."

      "To become a full ACCA member, you need both relevant work experience and to pass the exams. Here's a breakdown of the requirements:\n\n1. **Work Experience**: \n   - You must complete a minimum of 36 months of relevant work experience. This experience does not have to be continuous or within the same role/company [Source: https://www.accaglobal.com.cn/affiliate/requireper-121/potarget-48-121-908.html].\n   - The Practical Experience Requirement (PER) requires trainees to obtain three years of experience in a finance or accounting-related role [Source: https://www.accaglobal.com/gb/en/student/practical-experience-per/36-months-practical-experience.html].\n\n2. **Exams**:\n   - You must pass all 13 exams of the ACCA qualification [Source: https://www.accaglobal.com.cn/qualification/acca-qualification.html].\n   \n3. **Ethics and Professional Skills Module**:\n   - Completion of the Ethics and Professional Skills Module is also mandatory [Source: https://www.accaglobal.com/gb/en/member/membership/member-ready/path-to-membership.html].\n\nIn summary, simply passing the Qualification Programme (QP) exams is not sufficient; you also need to fulfill the work experience requirement. There are no sources suggesting that you can bypass the work experience requirement entirely.\n\nIf you have further questions or require clarification on any specific aspect, feel free to ask!"
